# Factorio-LaNMod
Losers and Nitwits' Mod: For us mere mortals, make the game short enough to finish in the duration of a LAN party.

This project is derived from [FactChild](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SimpleRecipes), a mod for children that serves a similar purpose.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a public repository (and fork), so comitted here its code with a lot of other changes as well.

This is a work in progress.  Please be patient.
